## HMC-Specifics
Version specific implementations of the [HeadlessMc](https://github.com/3arthqu4ke/HeadlessMc) runtime. Just place the
jar for your version in your mods folder. Then you need to find a way to send commands to your running Minecraft game.
The easiest way is probably to just launch it with HeadlessMc.
